# Raspberry Pi 5 Open Source Case

## Overview

Welcome to the **Raspberry Pi 5 Open Source Case** project! This repository contains the design files and instructions for creating a customizable, 3D-printable case for the Raspberry Pi 5. The case is designed to be functional, easy to assemble, and adaptable for various use cases. Whether you are a hobbyist, educator, or developer, this project aims to provide a reliable and aesthetic enclosure for your Raspberry Pi 5.

## Features

- **Customizable Design:** Modify the case to fit your specific needs using the included design files.
- **Easy Assembly:** Designed for straightforward assembly with minimal tools.
- **Ventilation:** Optimized for airflow to keep your Raspberry Pi cool.
- **Mounting Options:** Includes mounting points for various accessories and add-ons.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need the following:

- A 3D printer (or access to one)
- 3D printing filament (PLA, ABS, PETG, etc.)
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Basic tools (screwdriver, screws, etc.)

### Downloading the Files

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ismael-devTR/OpenSource-Rasp-case.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ismael-devTR/OpenSource-Rasp-case/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

### Printing the Case

1. Open the design files (`.stl` format) in your preferred slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
2. Adjust the print settings according to your filament type and printer specifications.
3. Slice the model and export the G-code.
4. Load the G-code onto your 3D printer and start printing.

### Assembly Instructions

1. **Prepare the Parts:**
   - Print the top cover, bottom base, and any additional components (e.g., side panels, mounting brackets).
2. **Fit the Raspberry Pi:**
   - Place the Raspberry Pi 5 into the bottom base, ensuring all ports align with the case openings.
3. **Secure the Raspberry Pi:**
   - Use screws to attach the Raspberry Pi to the mounting points within the case.
4. **Attach the Top Cover:**
   - Snap or screw the top cover onto the bottom base, ensuring a snug fit.
5. **Optional Add-ons:**
   - Attach any additional components or accessories as needed (e.g., fans, heat sinks).

## Customization

The design files are provided in `.stl` and `.f3d` (Fusion 360) formats. Feel free to modify the design to suit your specific requirements. If you make significant improvements or alterations, please consider contributing back to this repository.
